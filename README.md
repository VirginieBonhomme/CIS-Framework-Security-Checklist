# Comprehensive CIS Framework Security Checklist

This tool is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses enhance their cybersecurity posture by following the CIS Controls. It offers a structured, step-by-step approach to protecting critical assets, managing vulnerabilities, and improving response capabilities to security incidents. The checklist guides users through essential security practices, making it an invaluable resource for businesses aiming to strengthen their defenses.

Currently, users cannot save their progress on the checklist, but I am actively working on adding a backend to enable this functionality. This future update will allow users to track their progress over time, making it even more practical for ongoing security management.
